# <Personal-Portfolio>

## Description

This is a portfolio that I designed myself in order to show off personal projects to potential employers and colleagues. This project shows off previous as well as my current knowledge of web development technologies. 

This project demonstrates HTML and especially CSS proficiency.

The main problem I was trying to solve was to organize the divs properly in order to make the website look somewhat professional.

This project focused on CSS styling, primarily on organizing divs. In this project I focused on grouping divs into their respective container and orgainzing them at a container level. I also focused on making sure the website would dynamically change based on the device/screen width using Media Queries.
